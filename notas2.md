Bingo: the game

Bingo is a game that can take a variable number of players. We will not deal with the monetary dimension of it. Each player receives a card with a random set of M unique numbers (from 1 to , but not all, since M < N) and those numbers (deck) are then randomly selected by a caller (the game host, the entity that coordinates the evolution of the game) until a player completes a row in their card with the numbers selected so far. That player is the winner. It is possible to have several winners, though.
